This was a personal project I developed to aid me in my internship application process. Often I receive updates to my application status while I am out which made it difficult for me to keep my spreadsheet up to date.
I thought that a creative solution would be to train a NLP model using my own emails to be able to detect whether an email was application related and mark it with a certain label to refer to later.
I will not be providing the training dataset since it was fully madeup from emails to my personal account but the model was trained on 300 emails with 88 being application-related. The average accuracy of the model is 98%.

I am currently working on an issue with the program not continuously flipping through pages with large max_results sizes.
I am also working on a more elegant solution to terminating the program, for now enter control c in the terminal.
